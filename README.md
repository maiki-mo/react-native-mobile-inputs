# React Native Mobile Inputs
#### In Development
#

React Native Mobile Inputs was created to add validations and formatting to the native iOS and Android picker and [React Native Elements] input component.

# Purpose
##

Without a `Picker` component in the `React Native Elements` library, it is difficult to create a mobile input that references the international code and formats the number accordingly.  This package hopes to integrate a mobile int picker and mobile number input that interacts seemlessly with the `React Native Elements` package both logically and stylistically.

# Current Int Codes Supported
- +1 (US)
- +44 (UK)
- +33 (FR)
- +61 (AUS)

# Current Formatting and Validation Supported
- +1 (US)
- +44 (UK)
- +33 (FR)
- +61 (AUS)
